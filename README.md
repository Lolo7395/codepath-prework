## App Brainstorming (Notes)

(1)Example App: Instagram
- Bottom Board- where users can go to their profile, main page, explore pages, or search page
- the ability to change the background color in messages
- comment button
- like button

(2)Example App: Tik tok 
 - Scrolling
 - Comment button
 - like button
 - Add (+) -> the white button in the middle

(3) Example App: Pinterest 
- Pin Board-> I like how you can see the photos in a rectangle-shaped way, and you get to see multiple photos all once
- the ability to create your boards

(4) Example App: Facebook
- Users can create a community

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- I had trouble figuring out how the simulator worked; I didn't know the app would be within the simulator, which is so cool.
