# Prework App: Thoughts?

Submitted by: **Lorraine Mureya**

**Thoughts?** is an app where users can freely share their thoughts, stories, or opinions anonymously without revealing their identity. The app functions like a digital whiteboard, allowing you to jog down whatever's on your mind. Other users can engage by commenting, offering advice, or sharing their perspectives, creating a space for open and honest conversations. 

Time spent: **168** hours spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Notes)

(1)Example App: **Instagram**
- Bottom Board- where users can go to their profile, main page, explore pages, or search page
- Highlights and Explore Page
- Interactive Features- I like that you can add polls, questions, countdowns, stickers, and other stuff.
- vanish mode within the message
  
(2)Example App: **Tik tok** 
 - Scrolling - users scroll upward or downward to watch a video.
 - voice changers, text-speech, and sound layering
 - Stitching
 - Search functionality- users can explore content by keyword, sounds, users, or hashtags

(3) Example App: **Pinterest** 
- Pin Board in the Profile Section-> I like how you can see the photos in a rectangle-shaped way, and you get to see multiple photos all once
- Pin Builder

(4) Example App: **Facebook**
- groups and communities 
- event creation - users can create an event

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- I had a bit of trouble figuring out how the simulator worked at first, but I realized the app runs inside the simulator, which was so cool.
